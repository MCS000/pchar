pchar determines the burn rate of a propellant given a pressure 
versus time input file. 

The file Sample.dat is a sample pressure v time array.  The 
first column is time and the second column is pressure.

Sample.in represents the physical conficuration of the burning 
grain.  Note, this programs assume a stright core burner with 
both ends inhibited.

To run:
pchar -f Sample.in

Output is out.txt
