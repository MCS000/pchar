pchar determines the burn rate of a propellant given a pressure
versus time input file.

The file Sample.dat is a sample pressure v time array.  The
first column is time and the second column is pressure.

Sample.in represents the physical conficuration of the burning
grain.  Note, this programs assume a stright core burner with
both ends inhibited.

*Compile notes:
In pchar.cpp comment/uncomment the #define WINDOWS_COMPILE or GCC_COMPILE 
as needed.

*To run:
pchar -f Sample.in

Output is out.txt
